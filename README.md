💧 Water-Quality-Prediction-Dashboard
🌟 Project Overview

Predict concentrations of 9 key water pollutants using Random Forest Regression and an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
This project demonstrates a complete ML workflow: data preprocessing → modeling → evaluation → deployment.

🛠 Features

🔹 Predict pollutants based on Year & Station ID

🔹 Interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time predictions

🔹 Trend visualizations of pollutant levels over time & stations

🔹 Download results as CSV for analysis

🧰 Tech Stack

Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit
